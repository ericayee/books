title: "Reading While Black"
book: reading-while-black
author: Esau McCaulley
kindle: false
date: 2020-11-20
review: Thought-provoking and deeply felt, this book is rooted in a love and respect for Scripture and the God of liberation. As a non-Black person, this book inspired me to listen and lean into engaging with what the Bible has to say about race, justice and hope.
