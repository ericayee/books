        <p class="highlight__text">She changed tactics. She was going to have to be horribly inhospitable. “What are you doing here?” There was a lazy humor to the slouch of him. She gritted her teeth as he turned to her. “We haven’t seen each other in three years, but I agree with your assessment—it feels as if no time has passed at all. Of course I grant you permission to call me by just my surname. ‘Mr. Yu’ sounds all too stuffy between childhood friends, does it not? But ‘Jeremy’ would do just as well, if not better. You used to call me that.” “You.” Chloe took a deep breath. “I was addressing you by a common, indeed, a generic pronoun. Not your surname.” Yu wasn’t even his real surname; she knew that. It was just the one he’d given. Nothing about him was real.</p>

        <p class="highlight__text">In general, I tried to rely on my mother’s style of speech in choosing when to use a non-English word. Thus, for instance, when my mom talks about the practice of ancestor worship, she uses the verb bai instead of pray (I used the Hakka word pai in this book, rather than the Cantonese) and the word hoeng (again, my mom uses the Cantonese word rather than the Hakka one) to refer to incense sticks. (I asked my mom if I could include this in my author’s note, and she wants me to tell you that she considers ancestor worship to be a violation of the first of the Bible’s ten commandments against idolatry, and she hasn’t practiced it since she was a child. I told her that none of you would judge her for this, and I’m fairly certain I’m correct.)</p>

      <li class="highlight" id="my+professors+h">
        <p class="highlight__text">My professors had a point. One does not have to dig very far into history to see that fundamentalist Christians in the South (and the North) have indeed inflicted untold harm on Black people. They have used the Bible as justification for their sins, personal and corporate. But there is a second testimony possibly more important than the first. That is the testimony of Black Christians who saw in that same Bible the basis for their dignity and hope in a culture that often denied them both. In my professor’s attempt to take the Bible away from the fundamentalists, he also robbed the Black Christian of the rock on which they stood.</p>
