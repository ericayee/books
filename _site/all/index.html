      <h3 class="review__title">Why I loved it</h3>
      <p>Thought-provoking and deeply felt, this book is rooted in love and respect for Scripture and the God of liberation. As a non-Black person, I was inspired to listen and lean into engaging with what the Bible has to say about race, justice and hope.</p>

      <li class="highlight" id="my+professors+h">
        <p class="highlight__text">My professors had a point. One does not have to dig very far into history to see that fundamentalist Christians in the South (and the North) have indeed inflicted untold harm on Black people. They have used the Bible as justification for their sins, personal and corporate. But there is a second testimony possibly more important than the first. That is the testimony of Black Christians who saw in that same Bible the basis for their dignity and hope in a culture that often denied them both. In my professor’s attempt to take the Bible away from the fundamentalists, he also robbed the Black Christian of the rock on which they stood.</p>

      <li class="highlight" id="it+is+not+the+c">
        <p class="highlight__text">It is not the case that Blacks uniquely emphasized certain passages and read other Scriptures in light of them; what was unique was what enslaved Black people emphasized. They emphasized God as the liberator and humankind as one family united under the rule of Christ whose death for sins reconciles us to God. To put it more pointedly, I contend that the enslaved reading of the exodus as paradigmatic for understanding God’s character was more faithful to the biblical text than those who began with the Pauline slave passages.</p>

      <li class="highlight" id="but+the+dialogu">
        <p class="highlight__text">But the dialogue goes both ways. If our experiences pose particular and unique questions to the Scriptures, then the Scriptures also pose unique questions to us. Although there are some experiences that are common to humanity, there are also some ways in which the Bible will pose particular challenges to African Americans. For example, the theme of forgiveness and the universal kinship of humanity is both a boon and a trial for Black Christians because of the historic and ongoing oppression of Black people in this country.</p>

        <p class="highlight__text">The state has duties, and we can hold them accountable even if it means that we suffer for doing so peacefully. This suffering is only futile if the resurrection is a lie. If the resurrection is true, and the Christian stakes his or her entire existence on its truthfulness, then our peaceful witness testifies to a new and better way of being human that transcends the endless cycle of violence.</p>

This Christian theology of policing must remember that the state is only a steward or caretaker of persons. It did not create them and it does not own or define them. God is our creator, and he will have a word for those who attempt to mar the image of God in any person. We are being the Christians God called us to be when we remind the state of the limits of its power.</p>

It looks to the officer and demands that said officer recognize the tremendous responsibility and potential of the work that they do. If we undertake this task of calling on the officer and the state to be what God called them to be, then maybe the hopes of Black folks as they relate to the police in this country might be fulfilled.</p>

Drawing on the prophetic tradition, he has in mind behaving in such a way that their masters are drawn to God. This included, according to the Old Testament testimony, periodic refusal to obey. This is not slavery as evangelism. Instead, it is saying that even in slavery one has some ability to live in a way that testifies to their beliefs.</p>

She gritted her teeth as he turned to her. “We haven’t seen each other in three years, but I agree with your assessment—it feels as if no time has passed at all. Of course I grant you permission to call me by just my surname. ‘Mr. Yu’ sounds all too stuffy between childhood friends, does it not? But ‘Jeremy’ would do just as well, if not better. You used to call me that.” “You.” Chloe took a deep breath. “I was addressing you by a common, indeed, a generic pronoun. Not your surname.” Yu wasn’t even his real surname; she knew that. It was just the one he’d given. Nothing about him was real.</p>

        <p class="highlight__text">In general, I tried to rely on my mother’s style of speech in choosing when to use a non-English word. Thus, for instance, when my mom talks about the practice of ancestor worship, she uses the verb bai instead of pray (I used the Hakka word pai in this book, rather than the Cantonese) and the word hoeng (again, my mom uses the Cantonese word rather than the Hakka one) to refer to incense sticks. (I asked my mom if I could include this in my author’s note, and she wants me to tell you that she considers ancestor worship to be a violation of the first of the Bible’s ten commandments against idolatry, and she hasn’t practiced it since she was a child. I told her that none of you would judge her for this, and I’m fairly certain I’m correct.)</p>
